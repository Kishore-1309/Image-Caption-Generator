# Image-Caption-Generator
This project develops an advanced image caption generator using the Flickr8k dataset. Features are extracted with a modified Inception V3, and captions are generated with a transformer-based model. The attention mechanism aligns image regions with words. Evaluated with BLEU metrics, it aims to outperform traditional methods.
