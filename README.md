This project aims to create an advanced image caption generator capable of producing accurate and contextually meaningful descriptions of images. Utilizing the Flickr8k dataset, the project seeks to bridge the gap between visual features and natural language descriptions by focusing on extracting semantic and contextual relationships. 

Image features are extracted using a modified Inception V3 model, where the final classification layer is removed to obtain a 2048-dimensional feature vector for each image. The textual data, comprising captions from the dataset, undergoes preprocessing to align them with their corresponding image features. These processed image and text data form the foundation for your caption generation model.

Initially, an encoder-decoder architecture with LSTM was employed to generate captions. However, this method failed to capture meaningful semantic relationships between image features and text, resulting in suboptimal performance. To address this, your project incorporates transformers, which excel in modeling long-range dependencies and contextual relationships. Transformers allow the model to focus on different parts of an image and generate captions where each word corresponds to specific features of the image. This enables the model to associate visual regions with descriptive words effectively.

The core objective is to improve the accuracy of image captions by enhancing the alignment between image features and textual representations. By using the attention mechanism in transformers, your model dynamically attends to relevant image areas, producing captions that are semantically rich and contextually accurate. The generated captions are evaluated using BLEU metrics, ensuring a quantitative assessment of the model's performance.

Overall, this project aims to push the boundaries of image captioning by integrating advanced deep learning techniques. The combination of a modified Inception V3 for feature extraction and transformers for caption generation is expected to yield better results than existing methods, offering a more nuanced understanding of image content and its textual representation.
